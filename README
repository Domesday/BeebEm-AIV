BeebEm AIV
----------

This emulator a modifed version of BeebEm that includes emulation of the 'Advanced Intereactive Video'
features as used on the 1986 BBC Domesday Project.

The emulator was originally produced as a proof of concept for a  project called CAMiLEON a collaboration between
the Universities of Leeds and Michigan. 

The emulator is not yet complete, but it quite graphically illustrates the experience of using the original system.

Known Issues
------------ 

Currently works under windows only.

When the emulator fails to establish contact with the source of images, the program crashes instead of producing an
intelligent error message. 

After several interactions, it freezes. 

Movie emulation is very crude, and only shows every fifth frame. 

The movement of the cursor is rather quirky.
 
The event processing is very basic, and as a result, the response to the keyboard can be problematic.


Running the emulation on a Windows PC
-------------------------------------

You need to run a secondary program alongside the emulator proper in order to decompress the JPEG files.
This is the program Decompress.jar. You can just double click this, but the diagnostics are then lost.
In order to see the diagnostic output, open a command window, cd to the Domesday directory, and type...
java -jar Decompress.jar.
